This repository demonstrates the use of Terraform and Ansible to define and configure infrastructure and automation workflows.

Contents

terraform/ ‚Äî Infrastructure-as-code definitions. Terraform files to provision resources.

ansible/ ‚Äî Playbooks and roles for configuring systems after provisioning.

.gitignore ‚Äî Rules for ignoring local or large files so the repo stays clean.

LICENSE ‚Äî GPL-3.0 license governing reuse and distribution.

How to Use

Prerequisites

Terraform (version X.Y.Z) installed

Ansible (version A.B.C) installed

Access permissions or credentials for your cloud or environment (e.g. AWS, Azure, etc.)

Provision Infrastructure
Navigate to the terraform/ directory and run:

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply


This will create the resources defined in the Terraform configuration.

Configure After Provisioning
Once the infrastructure is up:

cd ../ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml


Adjust the inventory and playbooks as needed for the hosts you provisioned.

Best Practices & Notes

Do not commit binary provider files or .terraform/ directories. These are large and can be generated locally.

Maintain versioning of Terraform and Ansible scripts so the infrastructure is reproducible.

Store secrets or sensitive values securely (e.g. environment variables, secret manager, etc.), avoid hard-coding them in files.

Use modules or roles to reduce duplication when your infrastructure or configs grow.

This repository demonstrates the use of Terraform and Ansible to define, provision, and configure infrastructure.

Project Structure

terraform/ ‚Äî Terraform code to create infrastructure resources

ansible/ ‚Äî Ansible playbooks and roles for configuration

.gitignore ‚Äî Excludes unnecessary or large files such as .terraform/

LICENSE ‚Äî GPL-3.0 license

Requirements

Before using this repository, install:

Terraform

Ansible

A cloud provider account (such as AWS) with valid credentials

How to Use
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Mordonlan/beforehend-end--finaltargil.git
cd beforehend-end--finaltargil

2. Initialize and Apply Terraform

Navigate into the Terraform directory and run:

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply


terraform init ‚Äî downloads required providers and sets up the project

terraform plan ‚Äî shows what will be created or changed

terraform apply ‚Äî provisions the actual resources

3. Run Ansible Playbooks

Once Terraform finishes provisioning, use Ansible to configure the hosts:

cd ../ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml


inventory should list the hosts provisioned by Terraform

site.yml contains the playbooks to configure them

Notes and Best Practices

Do not commit .terraform/ or large binary files; they should be ignored with .gitignore.

Keep provider credentials outside of the repository. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.

Test infrastructure changes with terraform plan before applying.

Break down Terraform code into modules and Ansible playbooks into roles for scalability.

Do you want me to also add an example ansible/inventory file to the README so users know what it should look like?
